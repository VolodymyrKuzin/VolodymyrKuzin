# Hi there 👋 I'm Volodymyr Kuzin!

## 🛰️ About Me

I'm a student at the National Technical University of Ukraine studying Applied Mathematics. I'm passionate about leveraging geospatial data and satellite imagery to understand our changing planet 🌍.

My research interests include:

- Geospatial data analysis and processing 🗺️
- Machine learning applied to satellite data 🛰️🤖
- Remote sensing applications for forestry, agriculture, and more 🌲🌾

I love participating in hackathons and conferences to meet new people in the fields of engineering and computer science. In my free time, you can find me hiking in the mountains or stargazing on a clear night ⛰️ 🌌

## 📚 What I'm Learning

Currently exploring tools like QGIS, Google Earth Engine, AWS, and Python for geospatial analysis.

Looking to expand my skills in:

- Cloud computing platforms
- Statistical learning and neural networks
- Multispectral remote sensing
- Time series analysis
